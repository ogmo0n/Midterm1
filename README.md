# Midterm1
CIS214 Midterm v1

This is the first version of my CIS214 C# Midterm. 

This program uses the constructor in class Invoice to set and get a Part Number, Part Description, Part Quantity, and the Part's Price.

This satisfied the requirements for the assignment,
but I was not pleased with the idea of hardcoded values... so I made some extra version. 

Please see v2 and v3 that allow for user input
